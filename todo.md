- [ ] Add relative File Size to each lib
- [ ] Make it easy to generate static files for github pages
- [ ] Build in a default dev server for static ()
- [ ] Simplify the default template
- [ ] Build in always making the template file (for init)
- Static path is actually a folder path, use that as a refernce for where the other files refernce from
- Check that you need that forward slash in the renderer. Might be able to use the static refernce?
