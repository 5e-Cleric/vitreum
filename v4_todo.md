## v4 Ideas
- Switch over to using css.js by default.
  - Provide tooling to build sourcemaps and dump the result into the build folder.
- Remove `gulp` as a dependacy
  - You should just expose a series of functions to use
- Create some [global tooling](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#bin)
  - add a `jsx` tool that creates component folders for you. 
  - Add a `vitreum` tool that bootstraps a project for you
- Add in [react hot loading](https://github.com/milankinen/livereactload)
- Remove the dependacy on using a template engine
  - This will be tricky, as right now vitreum is using a double template system (tmpl -> bundle -> render)
  - Focus on using raw functions or strings. No fancy markup
