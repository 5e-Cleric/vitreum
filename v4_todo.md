## v4 Ideas
- ~Switch over to using css.js by default.~
  - Provide tooling to build sourcemaps and dump the result into the build folder.
  - css.js is too fincky
- Remove the need for an acrhitecture.json, keep the style list in memory
  - Rename the less task to be more generic 
- Remove `gulp` as a dependacy
  - You should just expose a series of functions to use
  - All tasks should be converted to using promises
- Create some [global tooling](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#bin)
  - Use [minimist](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minimist) 
  - add a `jsx` tool that creates component folders for you. 
  - Add a `vitreum` tool that bootstraps a project for you
    - Should create a gulpfile, server, client folder with one component 
- Add in [react hot loading](https://github.com/milankinen/livereactload)
- Remove the dependacy on using a template engine
  - This will be tricky, as right now vitreum is using a double template system (tmpl -> bundle -> render)
  - Focus on using raw functions or strings. No fancy markup
  - Consider using a react component for the main template, can pass the data via props.
  - default to using a base template internal to vitreum
- Switch to using Promises for all tasks
- Move your `animations.less` into it's own repo
  - Make it into a css.js file, with a build step to `.less` and `.css`
- Move all my regular css into a new repo and npm module
- Remove `headtags` and switch to using [Helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet) maybe?
  - Maybe not, I could build in my own `rewind` on vitreum render
- Build a new css moudle within vitreum for handling css processing
  - Use an external lib to do the CSS work, but this should be a tiny shim 
- Make `clearRequireCahce` on while in dev mode
